## Intro

Hello! My name is Dor, I am an engineer and a researcher. 

I hold a <i>B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering & Management</i> (Information Systems major), and an <i>M.Sc. in Information Management Engineering</i>, 
both were pursued at the Technion.

My interests revolve around the fields of software engineering, algorithms, data science and applied machine learning research.

Willing to use this web site for sharing my ideas and thoughts, tutorials or projects. Hope you find it useful :)

## Research

My research focuses on formal verification, safety issues of machine learning algorithms, and the intersection between these two fields.
