## Intro

Hello! I'm Dor, an engineer and a researcher.

I hold a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering & Management (Information Systems major), and an M.Sc. in Information Management Engineering, which I earned at the Technion.

My interests revolve around the fields of software engineering, algorithms, data science and applied machine learning research.

Willing to use this website as a medium for sharing my ideas and thoughts, tutorials or projects. Hope you find it useful :)

## Research

The topics of my research include formal verification methods, machine learning algorithms safety issues, and the intersection of the two fields.
